I worked as a full-stack web-developer within a UX agency to deliver superior experiences for web applications based on user-research. I implemented features in user-facing web pages whilst hardening our internal tools and processes. 

I also championed a number of engineering-health initiatives and sought out other 'DevOps' roles such as automating our backup processes and deployment infrastructure.
