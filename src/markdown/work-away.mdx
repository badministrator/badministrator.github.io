For an Australian travel startup I lead the Android development of a mobile app
for booking business travel. I delivered features for the app whilst
architecting and designing our high-level push-notifications platform.

With unique challenges in releasing separate versions our app across multiple
platforms and multiple environments, I also developed a set of bespoke tools to
manage our Release Engineering requirements.
