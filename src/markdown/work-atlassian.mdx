I worked within Atlassianâ€™s Design System Team to deliver technical
implementations of the Design Guidelines via a library of React components
called atlaskit.

I spent a lot of time thinking about API design and the boundaries of what a
component library should provide vs what flexibility should be left to
consumers. I led the initial implementation of `@atlaskit/side-navigation` -
which delivered an API that favoured composition over configuration allowing
Jira and Confluence to construct their navigations in a more idiomatic and
performant manner.
